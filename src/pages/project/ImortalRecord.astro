            Personal Contribution
        </h1>
    
        <h2 class="text-2xl">Lead Project Manager</h2>
        <p class="mt-2 pb-2">
            As the <strong>lead project manager</strong>, I was responsible for overseeing the entire development and publication process of the game. 
            My role required a balance of <strong>strategic planning, communication, and problem-solving</strong> to ensure smooth production and timely delivery.
        </p>
    
        <h2 class="text-2xl">Game Development Coordination</h2>
        <p class="mt-2 pb-2">
            A core part of my responsibilities was facilitating <strong>effective communication</strong> within the development team. 
            I worked closely with designers, programmers, and artists to <strong>brainstorm and refine game ideas</strong>, ensuring a cohesive vision for the final product.
            By maintaining regular meetings and status updates, I helped streamline workflow, resolve bottlenecks, and keep the team aligned with project goals.
        </p>
    
        <h2 class="text-2xl">Production Tracking</h2>
        <p class="mt-2 pb-2">
            I closely monitored the <strong>progress of development</strong>, ensuring that milestones were met within the designated timeline. 
            Using task management tools and milestone tracking, I identified areas requiring additional resources or adjustments to maintain efficiency. 
            This proactive approach helped prevent delays and kept the project on schedule.
        </p>
    
        <h2 class="text-2xl">Art Direction Assistance</h2>
        <p class="mt-2 pb-2">
            In addition to project oversight, I contributed to <strong>art direction</strong> by collaborating with artists to refine visual assets. 
            I provided feedback on key visuals, ensuring they aligned with the game's aesthetic and branding goals. 
            By guiding visual consistency, I helped strengthen the game's identity and appeal.
        </p>
    
        <h2 class="text-2xl">Game Testing & Quality Assurance</h2>
        <p class="mt-2 pb-2">
            I organized and supervised <strong>game testing sessions</strong> to gather feedback on mechanics, balance, and user experience. 
            By collecting player input and identifying potential issues, I compiled reports on <strong>bugs and areas for improvement</strong>, 
            which were then relayed to the development team for refinement.
        </p>
    
        <p class="mt-2 pb-2">
            This experience reinforced my expertise in <strong>project management, game production, and team coordination</strong>. 
            It has deepened my passion for leading creative projects and ensuring the successful execution of game development from concept to launch.
        </p>

        <h1 class="font-bold tracking-tight mt-8 text-gray-900 dark:text-white sm:text-4xl pb-6">
          What I Learn
      </h1>
      <div class="mx-auto text-gray-900 pb-16 px-1">
        <p class="mt-2">
          The biggest lesson is <strong>why I fail</strong>. The project was cancelled due to the lack of huge monetisation potential. My team initially wanted to build this game as an indie title which optimistically can earn sustainable revenue. 
          However, the company is part of the big corporation and the company wants to make a big hit. Even though this project won't cost much to develop, it doesn't fit the company's goal.
          In future, I will be more careful to choose the project that I will work on. I will make sure that the project <strong> aligns with the company's goal</strong> and has a <strong>clear revenue model</strong>.

      </p>
        <p class="mt-2">
            Other than the failure, this project has provided me with a <strong>game-producer-like perspective</strong>, allowing me to understand the complexities of game development 
            beyond just design and programming. I learned to balance <strong>budget constraints, timeline management, and production oversight</strong> to ensure 
            that the project stayed on track.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-2">
            A crucial part of my role involved <strong>gathering feedback from game testers</strong> and analyzing their insights to refine the gameplay experience. 
            Additionally, I estimated potential <strong>revenue projections</strong> and compiled detailed reports to present to my superiors, ensuring that our 
            development efforts aligned with business goals.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-2">
            This hands-on experience has given me a <strong>deeper appreciation for the challenges developers face</strong> throughout the game creation process. 
            It has humbled my approach to project management and strengthened my commitment to continuous learning. Moving forward, I am eager to 
            expand my skill set and further refine my expertise in game production and leadership.
