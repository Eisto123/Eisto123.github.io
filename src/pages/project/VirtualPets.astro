          Technical Overview</h1>
        <div class="mx-auto text-gray-900 px-1">
          <p class="mt-2">

          </p>
          
          <p class="mt-2">
            By owning a headset, I split the development work with my teammate so that I focus on the 
            interaction and the <strong>Meta SDK integration</strong>.
          </p>
          
          <p class="mt-2">
            I successfully integrated <strong>room scanning</strong>, <strong>distance grab</strong>, 
            <strong>real hand interaction</strong>, and <strong>generating nav mesh</strong> on the floor from 
            Meta SDK. I built samples from Meta to test out how each element works and 
            extract what we need for our project.
          </p>
          
          <p class="mt-2">
            I implemented <strong>Patting</strong> and <strong>Feeding</strong> interaction in the game, and I created a 
            <strong>debug tool</strong> to see log messages in the headset.
          </p>
          
          <p class="mt-2">
            I cooperated with the designer in our group, designed the animation graph, 
            and created the <strong>animation controller</strong> in Unity after the AI was done. 
            I set the animation based on the pet's behaviour. I also added sound effects 
            to each of the animations.
          </p>
          
          <p class="mt-2">
            I managed all the assets that the team created, loaded them into the project, and ensured 
            everything was rendered properly with the correct texture and size.
          </p>
          
          <p class="mt-2">
            Lastly, I was the <strong>QA tester</strong> for this project. Every time the team had a new update, I 
            built it to the headset, reviewed the results, and provided feedback to the 
            team. This was a time-consuming process, but I was very familiar with building and testing, 
            ensuring our team could always demonstrate the project on time.

        What I learn</h1>
        <div class="mx-auto text-gray-900 pb-16 px-1">
          <p class="mt-2">
            Through this project, I gained valuable hands-on experience in integrating <strong>Meta SDK</strong> features, such as 
            <strong>room scanning, distance grabbing, real hand interactions, and dynamic nav mesh generation</strong>. By building and analyzing 
            Meta’s samples, I deepened my understanding of how these technologies work and successfully applied them to our project.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-2">
            I enhanced my skills in <strong>interactive gameplay programming</strong> by implementing <strong>patting and feeding interactions</strong>, 
            as well as developing a <strong>debug tool</strong> to efficiently monitor log messages within the headset. Working closely with our designer, 
            I also contributed to the <strong>animation system</strong>, designing the animation graph, setting up controllers in Unity, and synchronizing 
            animations with pet behavior. Additionally, I integrated <strong>sound effects</strong> to enhance immersion.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-2">
            Beyond programming, I took on responsibilities in <strong>asset management</strong>, ensuring that all textures and models were correctly loaded, 
            rendered properly, and maintained their intended scale. My role as a <strong>QA tester</strong> strengthened my ability to systematically 
            <strong>build, test, and refine</strong> our project with each update, allowing our team to showcase a polished and functional prototype on time.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-2">
            Most importantly, this project reinforced the significance of <strong>good teamwork</strong>. By dividing tasks effectively, maintaining clear 
            communication, and continuously providing feedback, we ensured smooth collaboration. My ability to integrate contributions from different 
            team members and iterate based on testing feedback was essential in delivering a cohesive and high-quality experience.
