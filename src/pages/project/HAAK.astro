            Personal Contribution
        </h1>
    
        <h2 class="text-2xl">Publishing Operator</h2>
        <p class="mt-2 pb-2">
            I played a crucial role as a <strong>publishing operator</strong>, overseeing both <strong>visual marketing</strong> and <strong>community engagement</strong>. 
            My work spanned directing key visual assets, managing promotional content, and maintaining strong relationships with both players and distributors. HAAK has over 1.2 million downloads on mobile platform and is one of the best Metroidvania games in China.
        </p>
    
        <h2 class="text-2xl">Visual Marketing</h2>
        <p class="mt-2 pb-2">
            One of my primary responsibilities was directing <strong>high-impact visual assets</strong>, including the two key images shown below.
            These assets significantly improved <strong>mobile advertising click-through rates</strong> by capturing player attention with compelling composition and design.
        </p>

        </div>

        
        

        <p class="mt-2 pb-2">
            In addition to static visuals, I directed and edited the <strong>official promotional video</strong> for <em>HAAK</em>, which garnered 
            <strong>130,000 views on Bilibili</strong>. Through strategic scene selection, precise editing, and engaging pacing, 
            I crafted a promotional piece that effectively highlighted the game’s unique mechanics and atmosphere.
        </p>
    
        <h2 class="text-2xl">Distributor Relations</h2>
        <p class="mt-2 pb-2">
            I worked closely with <strong>various distributors</strong> to create <strong>tailored promotional images</strong> optimized for different sales channels.
            These assets played a crucial role in enhancing the game's visibility, contributing to increased engagement and overall sales performance.
        </p>
    
        <h2 class="text-2xl">Community Engagement</h2>
        <p class="mt-2 pb-2">
            Beyond marketing, I was responsible for <strong>player relations</strong>. I actively collected feedback from the community and facilitated communication 
            between players and the <strong>game development team</strong>. This open dialogue allowed us to continuously refine the game, improving the overall player experience.
        </p>
    
        <p class="mt-2 pb-2">
            Through this project, I gained valuable experience in <strong>marketing strategy, creative direction, and community management</strong>, 
            all of which were instrumental in successfully promoting and expanding the game's reach.

          What I Learn
      </h1>
      <div class="mx-auto text-gray-900 pb-16 px-1">
        <p class="mt-2">
            Publishing this game marked my <strong>first experience in the indie game industry</strong>, and it has been an incredibly enriching journey. 
            Throughout this process, I gained a deeper understanding of the video game market and learned how to effectively apply my skills 
            to support developers in promoting their games.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-2">
            I feel truly fortunate to have had the opportunity to help publish this <strong>passionate and creatively-driven indie game</strong>. 
            Its development and release embodied the true <strong>spirit of indie games</strong>, emphasizing innovation and artistic freedom. 
            Witnessing its growth reinforced my appreciation for independent game development.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-2">
            This experience has fueled my passion for <strong>supporting indie developers</strong> and strengthened my determination to contribute more 
            to the indie game community. Moving forward, I am eager to leverage my expertise in <strong>marketing, publishing, and community engagement</strong> 
            to help bring more unique and inspiring indie titles to a wider audience.
